# Data Visualization Track
For this track, your group will tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Your project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:

    Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)

    JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)


* How do I list all libraries in Python?
- We can type the following command into the Python prompt and it will display a list of all the modules that have been installed on the system.

    help("modules")

- We do not need to install any additional packages to list it; nevertheless, we must manually search or filter the list for the appropriate module.


    Using python-pip:
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    pip freeze 



2. Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).

3. Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
# Finance

### One option is offered by the Wall Street JournalLinks to an external site.. Their website offers a dashboarding tool providing a high-level view of market performance.

This highly interactive tool allows users to easily explore stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.

Users of all skill levels can use the data.

Visualizations help make the data easier to understand.

Multiple views are available for customized content.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:

* HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

* Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

* Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:

- JavaScript libraries

- Python in Jupyter Notebook

- Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally

### Remember: You have learned how to filter data in Pandas, JavaScript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB.

6. If possible, your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

7. Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:

* An overview of the project and its purpose

* Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

* At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

* References for the data source(s)

* References for any code used that is not your own
